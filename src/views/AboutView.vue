            aircraft tires and landing gear systems. Using high-quality test data, she validated theoretical predictions
            of the viscous behavior for a Space Shuttle Orbiter Nose- Gear Tire. These predictions are highly valued by
            the tire analysis and landing gear community as seen in several publications.
            <br>
            <br> -She developed and
            implemented a new state-of-the-art Aircraft Landing Dynamics Facility data acquisition system. After earning

            Engineering and Integration Branch at NASA’s GSFC. She was the lead Environmental Project Engineer for the
            Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project. She was responsible for leading the SDO Project’s environmental
            tests and integration efforts and provided environmental engineering expertise to other projects such as the
            John Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory’s New Horizons and the STEREO Spacecraft.
            <br>
            <br> -From 2006 to 2010, she was
            the Spacecraft Integration & Test (I&T) Manager in the Spacecraft Division for the $5.2B National

            <br> -Regina was born and raised in Nakuru, Kenya. She is a proud Delawarean for the
            last 18
            years. Growing up in Kenya’s Rift Valley in the ’80s and ’90s exposed Regina to life-changing experiences
            having witnessed the horrors of political violence; as her hometown, Nakuru was hard hit. While incidents of
            serious political violence have reduced, previously impacted areas continue to experience lingering effects
            and security and economic uncertainties.
