          <p><strong>Bio:</strong>
            <br>Avi is a self-taught programmer, published author, and the founder and CEO of Avi I.T. Inc. She has been teaching computer science locally and abroad for the past four years and has conducted research in the artificial intelligence field pertaining to algorithmic bias. To summarize her research, a racially diverse computer science field could mitigate problems caused by algorithmic biases such as the ones found in facial recognition software. She plans on continuing her research and publishing her reports. 
Additionally, Avi is the CIO of Upendo United Foundation, a nonprofit organization with a mission to support orphans and vulnerable children in Nakuru, Kenya, by remedying immediate challenges, hoping to extend outreach to other parts of Kenya & Sub-Saharan Africa. The overarching issues plaguing the area are hunger, juvenile homelessness, teenage pregnancies, lack of medical care, and lack of educational opportunities.
She holds various certifications ranging from app development, cyber security, game development, and website development to certifications in early childhood development. In 2022, Avi published the children's book Technology and Me. Avi wrote this book as an educational resource and a means of encouragement. The book provides a simplified explanation of technology, including how computers and the internet work and what technology allows us to do. Additionally, the book briefly mentions the digital divide and the lack of diversity in the computer science field to spread light on the reality of these issues.

            last 18
            years. Growing up in Kenya’s Rift Valley in the ’80s and ’90s exposed Regina to life-changing experiences, having witnessed the horrors of political violence as her hometown, Nakuru, was hard hit. While incidents of
            serious political violence has reduced, previously impacted areas continue to experience lingering effects
            and security and economic uncertainties. Over the last 18 years, juggling roles as a student and a
            single parent, Regina has directly supported over 20 orphans by paying for their education and sponsoring their
            basic
            needs, as well as those of their immediate family members.
            <br>
            <br> Through Regina’s leadership, Upendo United Foundation is supporting 140 orphans on a full-time basis with a goal of expanding their outreach. Regina is passionate about empowering children through education and imparting

            extend
